# Full-structural Noise (FUN) Learning

This repository contains the codes for producing results in the following paper: [Joint Hierarchical Bayesian Learning of Full-structure Noise for Brain Source Imaging](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cse.cuhk.edu.hk%2F~qdou%2Fpublic%2Fmedneurips2020%2F39_MedNeurIPS_2020_Workshop_FUN_learning_Hashemi_et_al_Camera_ready.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGNraBV-8mkkCfRQcZEA8m9Ks2ZIA), that has been presented in the [Medical Imaging Meets NeurIPS (Med-NeurIPS) 2020 workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/med-neurips-2020/home?authuser=0). 

This is a joint work with Chang Cai, Klaus-Robert Muller, Srikantan S. Nagarajan, and Stefan Haufe.
